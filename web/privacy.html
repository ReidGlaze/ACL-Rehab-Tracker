            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 5, 2025</p>

            <p>Twin Tip Solutions ("we", "our", or "us") operates the ACL Rehab mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our App.</p>

            <h2>1. Authentication</h2>
            <p>The App uses anonymous authentication provided by Firebase. This means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You do not need to create an account, provide an email address, or set a password.</li>
                <li>A unique anonymous identifier is automatically generated on your device to associate your data with your session.</li>
                <li>We do not collect any personally identifiable login credentials.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>When you use the App, we may collect and store the following information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Name</strong> &mdash; An optional first name you may provide during onboarding for personalization within the App.</li>
                <li><strong>Surgery Date</strong> &mdash; The date of your ACL surgery, used to calculate your recovery timeline.</li>
                <li><strong>Knee Measurements</strong> &mdash; Flexion and extension angle measurements that you record, along with the date and type of each measurement.</li>
                <li><strong>Photos</strong> &mdash; Photos of your knee taken through the App for AI-powered angle analysis. These images are uploaded to Firebase Storage and processed by our cloud-based AI service.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>Your information is used solely to provide the App's functionality:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Storing and displaying your measurement history.</li>
                <li>Generating progress charts and recovery timelines.</li>
                <li>Processing knee photos through our AI service to estimate knee angle.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
            <p>Your data is stored using Google Firebase services, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cloud Firestore</strong> &mdash; For storing your profile information and measurement records.</li>
                <li><strong>Firebase Storage</strong> &mdash; For storing knee photos you take within the App.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Data is stored securely and is associated with your anonymous user identifier. We do not sell, rent, or share your data with any third parties.</p>

            <h2>5. Camera Usage</h2>
            <p>The App requests access to your device's camera to take photos of your knee for angle measurement. Camera access is used exclusively for this purpose. Photos are uploaded to our secure servers for AI analysis and are not shared with any third parties.</p>

            <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>The App uses the following third-party services:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google Firebase</strong> &mdash; For authentication, data storage, and cloud functions. Firebase's privacy policy can be found at <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Google Gemini AI</strong> &mdash; For processing knee photos and estimating angles via a cloud function. Photos are sent to Google's AI service for analysis only.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not integrate any advertising networks, analytics SDKs, or other third-party tracking services.</p>

            <h2>7. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
            <p>Your data is retained as long as you use the App. If you wish to delete your data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can delete the App from your device, which will remove your local session.</li>
