            <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
            <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 5, 2025</p>

            <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using the ACL Rehab mobile application (the "App") operated by Twin Tip Solutions ("we", "our", or "us").</p>

            <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.</p>

            <h2>2. Not Medical Advice</h2>
            <p>The App is designed as a personal tracking tool for ACL rehabilitation progress. It is <strong>not a medical device</strong> and does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Specifically:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Knee angle measurements generated by the AI feature are estimates only and should not be relied upon for clinical decisions.</li>
                <li>The App does not replace professional medical evaluation or guidance from a licensed physical therapist, orthopedic surgeon, or other healthcare provider.</li>
                <li>Always consult with your healthcare provider regarding your rehabilitation program and any concerns about your recovery.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Use of the App</h2>
            <p>You agree to use the App only for its intended purpose of personal rehabilitation tracking. You agree not to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use the App for any unlawful purpose or in violation of any applicable laws.</li>
                <li>Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any part of the App.</li>
                <li>Interfere with or disrupt the App's functionality or the servers and networks used to provide the App.</li>
                <li>Use the App to collect or store personal data about other individuals.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. User Data</h2>
            <p>You are responsible for the data you enter into the App, including measurements and photos. By using the App, you grant us permission to store and process this data as described in our <a href="privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

            <h2>5. AI-Powered Measurements</h2>
            <p>The App includes an AI-powered feature that estimates knee angles from photographs. You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>These measurements are <strong>estimates only</strong> and may not be accurate.</li>
                <li>Accuracy depends on factors including photo angle, lighting, and positioning.</li>
                <li>AI measurements should be used for general tracking purposes only and not as a substitute for clinical measurement tools such as a goniometer.</li>
                <li>We make no guarantees regarding the accuracy or reliability of AI-generated measurements.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>The App and its contents, features, and functionality are owned by Twin Tip Solutions and are protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. You may not reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from any part of the App without our prior written consent.</p>

            <h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
            <p>The App is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties including, but not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</li>
                <li>Any warranty that the App will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free.</li>
                <li>Any warranty regarding the accuracy or reliability of measurements or results obtained through the App.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Twin Tip Solutions shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, or goodwill, arising out of or in connection with your use of the App.</p>
            <p>In no event shall our total liability to you for all claims relating to the App exceed the amount you paid for the App, if any.</p>

            <h2>9. Modifications to the App and Terms</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the App at any time without notice. We may also update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the App after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

            <h2>10. Termination</h2>
            <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the App at any time, without prior notice, for any reason, including if you breach these Terms.</p>
